/// it with the frame cache, and refresh the entry's metadata in place. The
/// entry keeps its [`MediaId`], so every clip referencing it recovers
/// without being touched.
///
/// Not undoable (no inverse): relink repairs project state to match the
/// disk after files moved, and "undo" back to a dead path is never what
/// the user wants. The session goes dirty so the repaired path gets saved.
///
/// The new file's metadata wins wholesale (dimensions, duration, rate,
/// audio). Relinking to a shorter file can leave clips with source windows
/// past the new end — tolerated the same way missing media is: the model
/// stores it, decode degrades, the next trim re-validates.
