//! Sidechain ducking analysis (audio roadmap M8 Phase 4).
//!
//! The pure DSP behind "duck the music under the narration": measure how
//! loud the *voice* lanes are in the speech band over time, turn that into a
//! gain-reduction curve (a classic threshold + attack/release ducker), then
//! thin the curve to the handful of points a volume envelope actually needs.
//!
//! Everything here is pure and sample-domain: it takes mono `f32` and returns
//! plain `Vec`s, with no media, model, or timeline types. The engine owns the
//! decode (via [`AudioReader`](crate::AudioReader)), the per-clip compositing
//! onto a shared timeline, and the mapping of [`reduce_curve`]'s indices into
//! clip-relative keyframe ticks. Keeping the DSP model-free is the same seam
//! the varispeed render uses (`render_stretched_curve` takes a closure rather
//! than a `Clip`), and it makes the tricky parts trivially unit-testable.
