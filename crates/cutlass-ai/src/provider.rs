//! The provider seam: chat completion with tool calling, behind one trait.
//!
//! Blocking by design — the agent runs on its own thread (never the UI
//! thread), and a synchronous trait keeps tokio out of the app. Streaming
//! is a text callback (for the chat panel) plus a completed [`ChatTurn`]
//! return; tool calls arrive whole, in the turn.
