//! Cutlass editing data model: project, media pool, timeline, tracks, clips.
//!
//! Design goals:
//! - **Correct types**: strongly-typed IDs (no mixing a [`TrackId`] with a
//!   [`ClipId`]), OTIO-style [`RationalTime`] (exact NTSC rates), and explicit
//!   timeline-vs-source ranges each carrying their own rate.
//! - **Fast lookup**: entities are stored in hash maps keyed by ID, so finding
//!   a clip/track/media by ID is O(1). The timeline keeps a `ClipId -> TrackId`
//!   index so a clip can be located across all tracks without scanning.
//! - **Independent testing**: this crate has no dependency on decode/render, so
//!   the model can be exercised in isolation.
//!
//! A [`Project`] owns one [`Timeline`] and a media pool of [`MediaSource`]s.
